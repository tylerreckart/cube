# Cube
A no-nonsense speedcubing timer and scrambler. Currently only works with 3x3 cubes.

## Todo  
- [ ] Log average time over 3, 5, and 10 solves
- [ ] Allow users select an inspection timeframe before the timer starts
- [ ] Regenerate scramble algorithm on timer stop
- [ ] Allow users to choose between more cube sizes
- [ ] Data visualization?
